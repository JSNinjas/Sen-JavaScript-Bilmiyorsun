## Çalışma 

The content for these books derives heavily from a series of training materials I teach professionally (in both public and private-corporate workshop format), called "Advanced JS: The 'What You Need To Know' Parts".

If you like this content and would like to contact me regarding conducting training on these, or other various JS/HTML5/node.js topics, please reach out to me through any of these channels listed here:

## Katılım

Any contributions you make to this effort **are of course greatly appreciated**.

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book series, as I (and O'Reilly) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but we just have to make the lawyers happy by explicitly stating it. So: blah, blah, blah... :)
